"4W2KV24X","presentation","2007","Grasland, Claude","Global City revisited by Tobler's first law of géography","","","","","","This paper propose to examine if Waldo Tobler’s first law of geography “ everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things” (Tobler, 1970) is still valid in a global world where many authors consider that distance in general and physical distance in particular are less and less important for the understanding of economic, political and social dynamics. Focusing on a “space of flows” rather than a “space of places” as it is proposed by many authors in their research on Global City does not mean that physical distance has to be  excluded from spatial interaction models, on the contrary.  We propose to explore a variant  of Tobler’s classical model of spatial interaction  - .(Fij.Dij) = Ai + Bj -  in order to demonstrate that the “movement” (product of flows by physical distance) is a much more interesting factor for the description of interaction between cities than the classical amount of flows. The advantage of this new formulation are both conceptual, methodological and empirical as it is demonstrated by an application to the air flows between world cities in 2000.  A new organization of the network of world cities according to air flows is elaborated which is more complex and less hierarchical than the one proposed in previous works. The paradox of the demonstration is that the introduction of distance support much more the assumption of a multipolarised and interlinked world than  usual works based on the location of global firms or the analysis of flows  non weighted by distance.","2007","2020-06-05 12:01:27","2020-06-05 12:04:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Montreux 'Suisse)","en","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","15TH European Colloquium on Theoretical and Quantitative Geography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At individual level four basic times of position and interaction are defined (geographical/sociological and discrete/continuous). It is then necessary to discuss the effects of scale aggregation and time dynamics on the elementary levels of position and interaction. This part is illustrated by examples about airflows between world cities in 2000 and euro coins diffusion across borders between 2002 and 2007.","2009","2020-06-05 11:53:21","2022-09-21 15:18:55","","117-174","","","","","","","UNIL • FGSE Workshop","series N° 2","","","FGSE, University of Lausanne","Lausanne, Switzerland","en","","","","","","","","","","","TTT-HAL","","Bavaud, François; Mager, Christophe","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From its incipient roots in landscape representation in geology and the mapping of socio-economic data in geography, it grew into its own sub-discipline with graduate programs, research paradigms, and a scientific literature of its own. It came close to establishing a national center for cartography In the late 1960s. After rather sporadic activity before World War II, the period from 1946 to 1986 saw the building of major graduate programs at the universities of Wisconsin, Kansas, and Washington. Other programs were created, often with the doctoral students from those three. At the end of the twentieth century, cartography underwent significant changes in relation to the emerging discipline of geographic information science. The future for academic cartography is less certain, as graduate programs adjust the balances among the many components of mapping science, including cartography, geovisualization, GI science, GIS systems, spatial analysis/statistics, and remote sensing.","2002","2020-06-03 13:03:51","2021-02-12 20:50:08","","305-321","","3","29","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Face à des difficultés méthodologiques de différentes natures, la carte de flux est, dès lors, toujours réalisée sur une partie des données disponibles. Elle est aussi souvent focalisée sur les lieux, en raison de difficultés spécifiques au maniement du figuré orienté, la flèche. L'objectif d'une carte de flux est pourtant de représenter (aussi) la partie de la matrice qui correspond à la quantité transférée entre les lieux, le flux et pas seulement son effet sur les lieux. Cela oblige à la résolution des problèmes rencontrés qui peut être réalisée à plusieurs moments du processus de cartographie. Nous proposons d'examiner des solutions qui sont d'ordre exclusivement sémiologique, qui autorisent la représentation de l'ensemble de l'information.

"DLYMHBUS","conferencePaper","2021","Josselin, Didier","An extension of the Tobler's law? Influence of the metric to compute the distance between an optimal facility and its demand points","European Colloquium on Theoretical and Quantitative Geography (ECTQG) 2021","","","","https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03505831","This research work presents an extension of the Tobler’s first law (TFL), that includes the metric used to measure the distance between a center and its demand points, in an optimal facility location problem framework (Hakimi, 1964). It provides a short overview of the works derived from the TFL and opens on the definition of a second law, less geographical and more mathematical. Indeed, its seems the distance, that is to say in our case a Lp-norm (a generalized Minkowski distance) considered to estimate a proximity between two points, has a strong weight on the meaning and on the shape of the TFL.  We organise our talk in several steps. We first recall the foundations and the geographical meaning of the Tobler’s first law (1970, 1971) which is still considered as a solid and reliable base in many disciplines (for instance, see the introduction in Cressie & Moores, 2021). This led to many citations of this law, which is indeed a geographically verified assumption rather than a demonstrated law.  We first draw a short history of this law (Cauvin & Reymond, 1991, Miller, 2004, Sui, 2004), provide a few examples of its usages (Grasland, 2009, Hecht & Moxley, 2009) and its extensions, especially in the context of the Santa-Barbara’s research group (Couclelis, 1996, Montello et al. 2003). We list and summarize several attempts to design a complementary or alternative second law in quantitative geography (Goodchild in Sui, 2004, Hecht & Moxley, 2009, Foresman & Luscombe, 2017, Josselin et al., 2017).  Then, in a second section, we move on transport and mobility concerns. We define the different purposes (efficacy, equity) of the principal centers used in geography (Beguin, 1989) and optimal location problem solving: k-median and k-center notably, to which we add the k-barycenter (modelling equality), that has interesting intermediate properties. We link these centers to their well-known objective functions. In a third section, we focus on the 1-facility optimal location, a refined formal framework to explain how we generalize the optimal center through Lp-norms (Peeters & Thomas, 2000). Using sensitivity analysis (Drezner & Hamacher, 2004), we find out by computation a generalized fonction linking center location sensitivity, demand point influence and distance between the center and the demands (Ciligot-Travain & Josselin, 2013, Josselin et al., 2016).  We use this function to draw new balanced optimal locations, respectively with p=1.5 and p=3 in the Lp-norm. For those, we map the demand point spatial influence of the center location. We develop more deeply the L3-norm, which catches our attention: it shows a particular property of a linear relation between the demand points weights and their distance to the optimel center. As we did previously with well-known k-median and k-center metrics, we associate new optimal centers a semantic, respectively “effility” and “equaquity” to those two compromises. In conclusion, we suggest how, in practical urban planning, our theoretical results can be potentially used to tune the effect of the distance on the demand point influence on the center. Finally, we draw up a comparison between our geographical law and the TFL: is our law an extension of the TFL or a second complementary law? We open a discussion about the proximity and distance collapse or reinforcement, as H. Couclelis put forward in 1996 and which is still a hot issue, from our perspective.","2021-11","2022-09-21 15:49:14","2022-09-21 15:49:40","2022-09-21 15:49:14","","","","","","","An extension of the Tobler's law?","","","","","","Manchester, United Kingdom","","","","","","HAL Archives Ouvertes","","","","","","TTT-HAL","distance; 1-facility location problem; Lp-norms; spatial compromise; Tobler's First Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cette relation met en évidence l'importance de l'espace géographique et particulièrement de la distance dans sa valeur et sa signification : la proximité est mesurée par la distance. Mais la distance fait appel à des métriques dont l'usage par l'observateur et l'interprétation ne sont pas neutres. Derrière la première loi de Tobler se cache une seconde loi, moins géographique, mais plus spatiale, qui dicte en partie la façon dont on peut évaluer des relations en géographie (Josselin, 2017). Cette seconde loi de la géographie s'appuie sur la distance (métrique) et l'organisation spatiale des lieux et objets géographiques. Notre réflexion est ancrée dans des travaux théoriques de généralisation de la norme Lp au problème de localisation optimale d'un centre servant k demandes dans un espace continu. La seconde loi de la géographie est révélée par une analyse de sensibilité (Drezner & Hamacher, 2004) des centres en fonction de déplacements infinitésimaux de la localisation des points de demande. Le principe est de déplacer les points de demande et d'observer le changement de localisation du centre (Ciligot-Travain & Josselin, 2009, Josselin & Ciligot-Travain, 2013, 2014) selon la norme Lp. Les résultats dévoilent des normes ayant des propriétés nouvelles dans la localisation optimale de centre. Des relations (log-)linéaires entre les exposants p des distances utilisées et l'influence des lieux dans la détermination de la localisation optimale du centre apparaissent. La loi proposée présente de façon quasi-continue l'impact du choix des métriques sur la fonction d'influence spatiale. On y retrouve les normes classiquement utilisées en analyse spatiale : équité pour la norme Linfinie, égalité pour la norme L2, efficacité pour la norme L1. Cette seconde loi montre à quel point la relation entre une facilité et sa demande est liée à la façon de calculer la proximité entre la demande et le centre. Elle se généralise à travers les échelles et relativise la loi de Tobler ou tout autre loi impliquant l'usage de la distance, dont on pourrait penser qu'elle est relativement peu influente sur la localisation optimale du centre.

"QQIW6BSI","conferencePaper","2019","Bahoken, Françoise","Cartograflow. Filtering Origin-Destination matrices For Flow Mapping Purposes in R","","","","","https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-02937178","The purpose of this communication is to present the implementation of {Cartograflow}, an R/Rstudio package dedicated to filtering Origin-Destination matrices for flow mapping purposes. It’s first main interest is to combine the preparation of flow dataset and their spatial representation within the same package. The second main interest of {Cartograflow} is that the proposed filtering functions are specifically part of the corpus of quantitative analysis methods in geography. This is why they are particularly interested, for examples, in the concentration of information, as well as the role of the geographic space in terms of the spacing of places of origin and destination by the distance travelled by the flow (in terms of distance and neighborhood). Finally, it is to be part of an open and reproducible research approach (Peng, 2011), compatible with existing solutions - mainly {sp}, {sf} and {cartography} (Giraud, Lambert, 2016), while opening possibilities to data describing spatial interactions patterns. Mapping flows to depict spatial interactions patterns raises specific problems related to the complexity of the information and its graphical representation (the so-called spaghetti effect). These problems are relate to the analysis of both statistical and geographical data, for thematic cartography purposes. If they can be solved from different perspectives, solutions that can be provided are either theoretical, methodological or lies in the development of specific tools as Tobler said (Tobler, 1967, 1970) to implement proposals in a given technological context. Considering the general interest in research issues related to the visualization of large graphs, particularly in interactive environments, one might think that the cartography of spatial interactions patterns have benefited from this context. Unfortunately, this prospect is illusory, except in a few cases. Geoweb applications dedicated to flows remain in the minority. The existing ones are limited to the direct display of flow dataset: they do not allow data processing that would enhance the figure. On the Geographic Information Systems side, despite efforts, the main software solutions, whether free or not, do not really help in the production of significant flow maps. There is also a recurring problem related to the management of the intrinsic complexity of relational data, which need at least filtered procedures before graphic representation. If issues regarding matrix filtering are carry out outside the mapping process, it is important to consider it to make an interesting map, i.e. useful for analysis in the social sciences and humanities. This is why we offer a new R/Rtudio package: {Cartograflow} by structuring and extending the appendices of Bahoken (2016). The purpose of this communication is to present the implementation of {Cartograflow}, an R/Rstudio package dedicated to filtering Origin-Destination matrices for flow mapping purposes. It’s first main interest is to combine the preparation of flow dataset and their spatial representation within the same package. The second main interest of {Cartograflow} is that the proposed filtering functions are specifically part of the corpus of quantitative analysis methods in geography. This is why they are particularly interested, for examples, in the concentration of information, as well as the role of the geographic space in terms of the spacing of places of origin and destination by the distance travelled by the flow (in terms of distance and neighborhood). Finally, it is to be part of an open and reproducible research approach (Peng, 2011), compatible with existing solutions - mainly {sp}, {sf} and {cartography} (Giraut, Lambert, 2016), while opening possibilities to data describing spatial interactions patterns.

According to Bertin's (1967), this practice reflects the exact application of the visual variable 'size' on the flow feature. Every other aesthetics and semiotic principles - as colored or curvilinear features - can be taken into account without fundamental consequences. This is very popular since earlier flow maps. It even seems to be the unique way to map flow, but is it relevant? Is it obvious that flow mapping raises one dimension of the features while the human eye may perceive several? Assuming that first hypothesis is exact means in fact that the human eye will perceive only one feature's dimension: its width (Fij). Is it really the case? We raise a reasonable doubt about the relevance of this assumption and will examine it in this paper. Our aim is to demonstrate the legitimacy of the conventional approach of flow mapping which leads to the first hypothesis. To do this, we will place us in the theoretical framework defined by Grasland (2009) leading to a joint (analysis of positions and flow. However, the present proposed perspective differs as the analysis is focused on the perceived information on a flow map. Therefore, we'll assume also Bertin's (1967) and Tobler's (1987) cartographic principles for mapping statistical flow data. We will then examine the corresponding cartographic process from two cognitive perspectives, regarding both semiotic and semantic aspects of the feature's flow map. We will explore a set of four assumptions (fig. 1). The fig. 1 describes through assumptions n°1 to n°4 what human eye perceived on a flow map and what it means. Firstly: the eye perceives only the feature's width (ass. n°1). The second assumption suggests the possibility of the perception of the feature's visual area, i.e regarding the amount of color (ass. n°2). It will lead us in a third assumption to the perceived geometric feature's area, that is to say the arithmetic product of the feature's width and length (ass. n°3). This theoretical semantic switching is not trivial; it corresponds to the perception of a new dimension: the cartographic distance, derived from the formal 'graphic distance' (Müller, 1979; Tobler, 1997; L'hostis, 2003), that is equal to the feature's length (Lij) perceived on the map. This effective joint perception of (Lij) and (Fij) leads us to introduce geographic space in flow mapping process, considering Tobler's (1969) first law of geography. This seems in other words to integrate the fact that flow values (Fij) are projected over a geographical area, consisting of (i,j) places that are more or less distant (Dij) or close in the reality... The places' remoteness influences the significance of the perceived flow value as well as in a flow map (but not in a plan as a spatialized graph which has no geographic properties). Assuming the fourth hypothesis (ass. n°4) is exact involves us carrying out a map of movement (Mij) rather than a map of flow (Fij). We demonstrate on selected bilateral international trade flows from Chelem database that if the cartographic construction of (Fij) and (Mij) is the same and unique (ass. n°1 and n°4 are equals), they differ only in their interpretation (Fij) C (Mij) for one main raison: at a world scale, flow mapping can only be an approximation of the geographical movement (fig. 2), as was done earlier by Minard (1862).","2015-09","2022-09-21 16:55:22","2022-09-21 16:56:12","2022-09-21 16:55:22","3p","","","","","","Flow mapping vs movement mapping","","","","","Politecnico di Bari","Bari, Italie","","","","","","HAL Archives Ouvertes","","","","","","TTT-HAL","CARTOGRAPHIE; CARTE; FLOW MAPPING; FLUX DE MARCHANDISE; FLUX DE MARCHANDISES; INTERNATIONAL; MAP COGNITION; MAP VISUALIZATION; MOVEMENT MAPPING; ORIGINE DESTINATION; PROJECTION; WORLD SCALE","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
